# 8Bit-Fighter

 Some of the dependensies are too large for github, if you want to play this yourself
 see  www.libsdl.org/projects/old/SDL_ttf/docs/index.html
 to download sdl_ttf, this is just a dll

Additionally, the this game is meant for multiplayer, so in order to play
one can host locally by finding their ipv4 , private or public depending on
who you want to play with, and make sure that every player has visibility of that host-ip
the actual server code does not need direct visibility of any ips
