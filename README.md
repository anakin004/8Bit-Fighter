# 8Bit-Fighter

This was a very fun projec to make, and was my first every multiplayer game

Additionally, the this game is meant for multiplayer, so in order to play
one can host locally by finding their ipv4 , private or public depending on
who you want to play with, and make sure that every player has visibility of that host-ip
the actual server code does not need direct visibility of any ips
