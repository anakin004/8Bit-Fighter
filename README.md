# 8Bit-Fighter

This was a very fun project to make, and was my first multiplayer game

---

Game is meant for multiplayer, but if you set max players to 1 this will work but server needs to be booted,
so in order to play one can host locally by finding their ipv4 , private or public depending on
who you want to play with, and make sure that every player has visibility of that host-ip
the actual server code does not need direct visibility of any ips
